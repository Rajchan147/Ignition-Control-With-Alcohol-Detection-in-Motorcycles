# Ignition-Control-With-Alcohol-Detection-in-Motorcycles
 An ignition prevention system for to reduce drunk and driving accidents
  
Due to the unavoidability of road accidents necessitating a variety of safety precautions and measures to avert catastrophes, the majority of reported cases involve motorcycles, with driven-by incidents being the most prevalent. 

In order to address the issue at hand, a proposed device is presented that utilizes the Arduino Uno Rev3 microcontroller kit and a MQ-3 gas sensor to monitor a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) and immobilize their motorcycle if intoxicated.The sensor set to a threshold level that guarantees the presence of the substance.

The initial objective of the work is to detect a person's blood alcohol concentration (BAC) and allow the system to determine whether the driver is fit to operate the bike or not based on the condition. If the BAC threshold is exceeded, the MQ-3 sensor will identify the presence of gas and lock the ignition; otherwise, the biker may operate the bike while not intoxicated. 

This will guarantee the lives of pedestrians and drivers a like by devoiding alcohol from the roadways.This undertaking presents a resolution to a prevalent issue that affects numerous individuals; it will substantially mitigate the likelihood of collisions and driving under the influence (DUI)
